change the summarize w cubai for youtube so that
-> when clicked, it sends the gemini model the entire transcription with accurate timings formatted.
-> remove the ask a follow up question thingy.
-> i can normally chat from after the summary.
-> the transcription is still there in the conversation history/memory of the model so it responds accurately.
-> basically continuing the conversation
